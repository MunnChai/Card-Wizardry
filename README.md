**Card Wizardry** is a card game, where you battle opponents in a turn based style, playing
different cards in your deck to do certain actions, such as *attack* or *heal*. This game will have
many features, such as:

cards to prepare for your next battle. 
- ***MANY* Customizable Decks:** You will be able to save multiple decks, which you can choose between.

your *beautiful, perfectly optimized decks*.
